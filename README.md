# Xbuyer
This is the project of MadHack 2019

Xbuyer is an app that will remind the customers when the commodities will expire by scanning their reciept. We focus on lightweight and simple operation that the users will only need to take a snap of their reciepts and then our Computer Vision Tools will automatically read the texts on the reciept and return the expiration dates of every individual food.
